# Mars-Pi
A project to connect raspberry pi with the MARS environment data.

The project uses the MARS data from the website http://marsweather.ingenology.com/ and connects it with raspberry pi and then calls it at intervals to provide the data. It can be either spoken out or be displayed on the screen.
